                <p class="text-small">
                    Why education systems need to be redesigned to meet the challenges of an uncertain future. Today most people end up in careers that have nothing to do with what they studied.
                    Education in the future will need to demonstrate how technology can be used to students' advantage, as well as teach future generations how to handle problems that arise from it. “Technology can change learning forever and we need to embrace it and manipulate it to our advantage,” McLaughlin says.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big"> Positive Education</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Positive education is an approach to education that draws on positive
                 psychology's emphasis of individual strengths and personal motivation to promote learning. 
                 Unlike traditional school approaches in which teachers attempt to tailor their material to 
                 a mythical "average" student, and move the class altogether using the material through one 
                 teaching and testing style, positive schooling teachers use techniques that focus on the 
                 well-being of individual students. Teachers use methods such as developing tailored goals 
                 for each student to engender learning and working with them to develop the plans and motivation 
                 to reach their goals. Rather than pushing students to achieve at a set grade level, seen through 
                 the emphasis of standardized testing, this approach attempts to customize learning goals 
                 to individual students' levels. Instead of setting students to compete against one another,
                  learning is viewed as a cooperative process where teachers learn to respect their 
                  students and each student's input is valued.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Educational psychology is the branch of psychology concerned
                 with the scientific study of human learning. The study of learning processes, from both 
                 cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual 
                 differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation,
                  and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology
                   relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance
                    educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management,
                     and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational
                      settings across the lifespan.

                 <b>Michael Jackson Yafir Nelson Mandela</b>,<b>Dr. BR Ambedkar</b> we all have one thing in common. He never gives up his courage,
                  so we should not be encouraged by our goals. Should Nelson Mandela remain in jail for 27 years, even
                   then he did not give up. But these things have to be said.
